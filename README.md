# Industrial Mini Robot
Personal - a little bit ambitious -  Project to build and program a 6DF "industrial robot arm", which includes of lot of learning for me.


# Ideas & Basic Concepts
Brainstorming:
The robot will be designed from scratch, utilizing harmonic or cycloidal (to be defined) drives for the actuators.
The software will be either C++ or Python (or both?).

# Implementation

## Hardware Design
The goal is to make the mechanical part, especially the joins and actuators, fully 3D printable.
All the rest should be standard parts available in a hardware store nearby.
There is no intention to design complex electronical parts, this should be fully standard parts, e.g Raspberry Pi or ESP32.

## Software Design
As mentioned in the Hardware design section, the software should run on a Raspberry Pi / ESP32.
This device should control the robot (movement of joints, inverse kinematics) and take inputs from a "main computer".

# Lessons Learned
Nothing y by now :-)

# Reference Material
As I'm still in the planning phase I use this section to collect maybe(!) usefull references.
Later this list will be updated and less useful/not used stuff will be removed.
