# Industrial Mini Robot
Personal - a little bit ambitious -  Project to build and program a 6DF, which includes of lot of learning for me.


# Ideas & Basic Concepts
Brainstorming:
The robot will be designed from scratch, utilizing harmonic or cycloidal (to be defined) drives for the actuators.
The software will be either C++ or Python (or both?).

# Implementation

## Hardware Design

## Software Design

# Lessons Learned

# Reference Material
As I'm still in the planning phase I use this section to collect maybe(!) usefull references.
Later this list will be updated and less useful/not used stuff will be removed.
